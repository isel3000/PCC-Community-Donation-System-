        <p>The <strong> Community Help Donation Management System </strong> is designed for local communities or barangays that regularly organize outreach programs and donation drives. Many communities rely on manual lists to track donated goods, which often leads to errors or missing data.</p>
  
        <p>This system allows barangay officials and volunteers to record and update donation details instantly, keeping the process organized and transparent. It stores data using JSON and processes it with JavaScript for real-time updates. Donors can give funds, clothes, or food and see their impact immediately.</p>

        <p>By promoting accessibility, fairness, and accountability, this project proves how simple web technologies can make a real difference in communities, helping promote the spirit of helping others efficiently.</p>
